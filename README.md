# Java Spring JSON API with JWT Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through how to create a Blog API with JSON API and JWTs.

The final code for this project can be found at: https://github.com/rtablada/java-blog-api

The API can be used to power this Ember App: https://ember-twiddle.com/642a321b6f62cc48a1efa345662e4764

> **NOTE** Ember Twiddle now requires `HTTPS` so you will need to click on the "Allow unsafe scripts" button in the Chrome address bar.
> You will also need to add `@CrossOrigin(origins = "*")` to each controller as noted in the lesson on [Security and CORS](06-security-and-cors.md).
